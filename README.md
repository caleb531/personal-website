# Personal Website

This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)-based personal website I created
for myself. The theme is built from Gatsby's default scaffolding, with all of
the styling migrated from my previous Jekyll iteration of the site.

## Setup

### Installing

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
npm install
```

### Serving the site

```bash
gatsby develop
```

The site will then be viewable in your browser at http://localhost:8000.
