# Personal Website

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)-based personal website I created
for myself. The theme is built from NextJS's default scaffolding, with all of
the styling migrated from my previous Gatsby and Jekyll iterations of the site.

## Setup

### Installing

This project uses [pnpm][pnpm] (instead of npm) for package installation and
management.

[pnpm]: https://pnpm.io/

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
```

### Serving the site

```bash
pnpm exec pnpm dev
```

The site will then be viewable in your browser at http://localhost:5173.
