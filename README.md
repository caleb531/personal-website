# Personal Website

This is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based personal website I built for
myself. I built the current theme from the Jekyll 3 default theme.

## Installing Jekyll

To build this site, you must first install Jekyll (which requires Ruby and
Node):

```bash
gem install jekyll
```

## Viewing the site

To view the development site locally, run:

```bash
jekyll serve
```

You will then be able to view the site in your browser at `localhost:4000`.
