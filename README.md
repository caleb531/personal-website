This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)-based personal website I created
for myself. The theme is built from NextJS's default scaffolding, with all of
the styling migrated from my previous Gatsby and Jekyll iterations of the site.

Live Site: https://calebevans.me/

## Setup

### Installing

```bash
npm install
```

### Serving the site

```bash
npx next develop
```

The site will then be viewable in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
