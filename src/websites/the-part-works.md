The Part Works was one of our clients when I worked at SuiteCentric for NetSuite development. The entire website is written using NetSuite's web store platform, SuiteCommerce Advanced (SCA), and I've collaborated extensively with the company's CEO and colleagues on page design, enhancements, and bug fixes (many of which I also had the pleasure of implementing). And finally, I've also performed several of the website's upgrades to the latest release of SCA.
