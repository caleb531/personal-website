  "content": "I created this site in 2014 for the North County chapter of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, a college ministry I was apart of. The site is centered around the ministry's small group Bible studies, which are led by student leaders on the college campuses in the region. I designed the site's front and and back end, and since its creation, I have poured countless hours of time and effort into maintaining, polishing, and enhancing the site."
