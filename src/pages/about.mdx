description: About the life and interests of Caleb Evans, coder for Christ

### Who are you?

I'm Caleb Evans, a web developer with many passions: programming, spending time
with family and friends, watching (and quoting) movies, trampolining, and
eating quality pizza. I currently reside in Carlsbad, California, having just
finished my Bachelor's in Computer Science at CSU San Marcos.

### What do you do?

Since 2010, I've been programming for school and for fun. My most prominent work
includes a plethora of web apps and useful tools, many of which were created to
automate what I grew tired of doing manually. Others I created simply for fun.

### Why do you code?

Besides the fact that I greatly enjoy coding, I make it my aim to code for
Christ, who has always walked with me as my Lord, my Friend, and my Savior. I
code because I believe the work of my hands glorifies God through the
creativity I express, and ultimately, through the lives enriched by my
projects.

### How many languages do you speak?

I am fluent in over six million forms of... ha, just kidding. I am fluent in
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP, since most of my projects are web-based. I'm
also well-versed in Python, and I fiddle with Bash regularly in an effort to
improve my developer workflow.

### What is your favorite language?

If I could choose only one, my favorite language would definitely be TypeScript
because of how many bugs it saves me from every time I write it. Plus, I
thoroughly enjoy working with the ES6 language features like promises,
destructuring, and arrow functions.

### What is your code editor of choice?

For years, I used [Atom][atom], but nowadays, I use [VS Code][vscode] for its
powerful feature set, excellent TypeScript support, and better performance on
M1 Macs. You can view my configuration for both editors at my public
[dotfiles][dotfiles] repository.

[vscode]: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Tabs or spaces?

That depends. In VS Code (with the "Sticky Tab Stops" setting enabled), spaces
behave the same as tabs when used as indentation, so I generally conform to the
convention of whichever language I'm writing in.

### What's the story behind your project icons?

I actually made them myself; each icon is written in pure SVG markup.
