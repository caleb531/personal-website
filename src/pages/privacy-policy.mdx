This privacy policy serves as a straightforward explanation of how this website
collects and handles your personal information. Please note that the term "this
website" encompasses:

- All personal website pages hosted on the **calebevans.me** domain
- All web apps, websites, and other projects hosted on all **\*.calebevans.me** subdomains

This privacy policy was last updated on June 22nd, 2020.

### Secure Connection

Your connection to this website is fully encrypted via HTTPS, including (but not
limited to) all stylesheets, scripts, and images. For more comprehensive
details, see the [SSL Labs report for calebevans.me][ssl-report].

### Local Storage

The apps on this website use the HTML5 Local Storage API to store user-inputted
data and preferences. All of this data remains on your computer, and can be
cleared through your web browser. The data contains no personally-identifiable
information except whatever information you may enter into the app. To be clear,
however, this data is not sent to anyone.

### Sharing Features

Some of my apps (like [Expressions][expressions]) have sharing features that
work by uploading your content to this website's server. This content never
leaves the server and is only used to enable this sharing functionality to
function.

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. I only use this information to examine
traffic trends and visitor statistics (i.e. the percentage of Chrome users).
However, you would need to read the [Google Analytics privacy summary][privacy]
to understand how Google collects and uses this information. I do not otherwise
share this information.

### Contacting Me

If you choose to email me through this website, I will not share your email with
anyone else, nor will I use it for marketing purposes.

### Changes

This privacy policy may change at any time. When changes are made, the date at
the top of this policy will be updated.
