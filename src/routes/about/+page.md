### Who are you?

I'm Caleb Evans, a web developer from Carlsbad, California with many passions:
programming, spending time with family and friends, watching (and quoting)
movies, trampolining, and eating quality pizza.

### What do you do?

Since 2010, I've been programming for work, for school, and for fun. My most
prominent work includes a plethora of web apps and useful tools, many of which
were created to automate what I grew tired of doing manually. Others I created
simply for fun. With a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science under my belt, I
aim to build apps that are enjoyable, functional, and adhere to best practices.

### Why do you code?

Besides the fact that I thoroughly enjoy programming, I make it my aim to code
for Christ, who has walked with me as my Lord, my Friend, and my Savior. I
believe the work of my hands glorifies God through the creativity I express, and
ultimately, through the lives enriched by my projects.

### How many languages do you speak?

I am fluent in HTML5, CSS/Sass, and JavaScript/Node, and have recently immersed
myself in TypeScript. I'm also well-versed in Python, and I fiddle with Bash
regularly in an effort to improve my development workflow.

### What is your favorite language?

If I could choose only one, my favorite language would definitely be TypeScript
because of how many bugs it saves me from every time I write in it. Plus, I
thoroughly enjoy working with the ES6 language features like promises,
destructuring, and arrow functions.

### What is your code editor of choice?

For years, I used [Atom][atom], but nowadays, I use [VS Code][vscode] for its
powerful feature set, excellent TypeScript support, and better performance on M1
Macs. You can view my configuration for both editors at my public
[dotfiles][dotfiles] repository.

[vscode]: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Tabs or spaces?

That depends. In VS Code (with the "Sticky Tab Stops" setting enabled), spaces
behave the same as tabs when used as indentation, so I generally conform to the
convention of whichever language I'm writing in.

### What's the story behind your project icons?

I actually made them myself; each icon is written in pure SVG markup.
