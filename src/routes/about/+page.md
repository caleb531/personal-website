I'm Caleb Evans, a web developer based in Carlsbad, California. My professional
career spans the past nine years, although I've been creating for the web since 2010. During that time, I've delivered large e-commerce platforms serving tens
of thousands of users, as well as sophisticated enterprise rebate systems for
customers like Pfizer and Novartis. Outside of my professional work, you'll
still find me contributing to open source and exploring the boundaries of
generative AI in software. I also enjoy spending time with family and friends,
whether it's over a pizza lunch or a thought-provoking sci-fi thriller.

### From Curiosity to Craft

My journey began with the simple thrill of taking my ideas and making them real.
That curiosity matured into a discipline: more than 60 personal projects—some
earning hundreds of GitHub stars and active users—helped me develop a
versatility to tackle technical and UX challenges across a wide variety of
domains.

### Faith & Purpose

I code for Christ—my Lord, Friend, and Savior—through the conviction that my
expression of creativity can be an act of worship. If an application I build
reduces friction, empowers a team, or lightens a user's cognitive load, then I
have glorified Him by creating an experience that is enjoyable and useful.

### Languages & Tools

By far, I am most fluent in the languages of modern web development:
TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node. I've spent significant time with
React, although I greatly enjoy working with Svelte+SvelteKit for my more recent
projects (including this website!). Besides the web, I enjoy programming in
Python for productivity scripts and Alfred workflows.

### Preferences

#### Editor

My editor of choice is unsurprisingly [VS Code][vscode] for its performance,
rich extension ecosystem, and TypeScript ergonomics (my full setup lives in
[dotfiles][dotfiles]). I used [Atom][atom] for many years, but when its future
became uncertain, I spent a few months of concerted effort to migrate my
workflow to VS Code. Years later, I couldn't be happier with my setup,
especially with the integration of GitHub Copilot for more productive
development and conceptualization.

#### Tabs vs. Spaces

Regarding the question of tabs vs. spaces, I lean toward clarity over dogma—VS
Code's "Sticky Tab Stops" setting enables predictable behavior for spaces, so I
tend to follow the indentation convention for whichever language I'm writing.

#### AI

When I need to tackle, for example, massive and unwieldy refactors, I reach for
GitHub Copilot with GPT-5 Codex. After much experimentation—and some
disheartening experiences with Sonnet 4.5—I've found Codex to be the most
consistently effective model with an impressive understanding of intent. Of
course, I'm eager to test the future models that emerge from this nascent,
volatile AI-driven market.
