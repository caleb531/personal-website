I created this site in 2011 for a high school class apart of the [Virtual
Enterprise](https://veinternational.org/) program, where schools across the
nation would create virtual businesses, trading with each other and competing
against each other. Our business was a clothing company called Static Stitches,
and I held the sole web developer position at this virtual company of ours. Most
notably, we traveled to Bakersfield in November 2011 for the annual VE
California State Trade Show, where this website won First Place in the Advanced
Website Division.
