I created this site in 2014 for the North County chapter of InterVarsity
Christian Fellowship, a college ministry I am apart of. The site is centered
around the ministry's small group Bible studies, which are led by student
leaders on the college campuses in the region. I designed the site's front and
and back end, and since its creation, I have devoted countless hours of time and
effort into maintaining, polishing, and enhancing the site.
