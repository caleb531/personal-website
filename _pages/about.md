### Who are you?

I'm Caleb Evans, a college student with many passions: coding for Christ, spending time with family, watching red panda videos, and eating impressively large quantities of pizza. I currently reside in Carlsbad, California, attending college with a goal of earning a degree in computer science.

### What do you do?

Since 2010, I've been programming in many languages for school and for fun. My most prominent work includes a plethora of web apps and useful tools—many of which were created to enhance my productivity and actualize my ideas. I've also crafted a number of websites (for myself and for others) using PHP, WordPress, and even Jekyll.

### How many languages do you speak?

First and foremost, I am fluent in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP, since most of my projects are Web-based. However, as I have grown very fond of Python over the years, I've also created a handful of useful Python-based utilities (all of which are fully unit tested with 100% coverage). Besides that, I've written numerous AppleScripts to improve my workflow and I've muddled with Bash for configuring my development environment, among other things. I've even worked with Java and C++ for school, though I can't say I'm a fan.

### What is your favorite language?

By far, Python is my favorite language (especially Python 3). It's a wonderful language to work with, as the language itself is highly expressive, flexible, powerful, and readable. I have also found that Python makes crafting sophisticated projects amazingly easy and quick. I highly recommend the language for anyone who enjoys coding for fun.

### What is your code editor of choice?

I use [Atom](https://atom.io/), an open-source editor developed by GitHub. The editor is built with the latest web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS), which makes it impressively customizable while keeping it incredibly easy to use. For those interested in giving it a try, you can view my complete Atom configuration (including the packages I use) on my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/caleb531/dotfiles).

### Tabs or spaces?

That depends. In Atom, spaces behave just like tabs when used for indentation, and the [editorconfig package](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-editorconfig) I use automatically switches between using tabs and spaces on a per-project basis. Therefore, the difference feels practically imperceptible to me, and so my choice generally depends on the context. For instance, when I write Python, I always use spaces in accordance with the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation). For my WordPress plugins and themes, I use tabs in accordance with the [WordPress coding standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/). For everything else, I simply default to using tabs.

### What's the story behind your project icons?

I'm so glad you asked! I actually made them myself.

I meticulously crafted each icon using SVG, a vector image format which is both portable and infinitely scalable. I didn't use any sort of vector-drawing application to hand-draw each icon, but rather I wrote all of the code by hand.

Considering that I have over 40 projects, I had to write the code for over 40 icons, where each icon was carefully conceived and designed. Indeed, it took much time and effort, but I had great fun doing it. I also found that hand-writing the code for each icon provided the following benefits:

1. Precision: I can achieve maximal precision because I have total control over the numbers; this can also make some icons quite challenging to draw, but I still consider the flexibility worth the additional effort in those cases.
2. Portability: I'm not tied to a specific vector application; I can write SVG anywhere, though I naturally choose to use Atom (I've created [a number of handy-dandy SVG snippets for Emmet](https://github.com/caleb531/dotfiles/blob/master/emmet/snippets.json)).
3. Maintainability: I can make changes to multiple projects at once simply by using Atom's project-wide **Find And Replace** panel. For instance, I try to use a consistent palette of colors across many of my icons, and if I ever need to change the same color across multiple icons, doing so is as easy as `shift-cmd-f`.
