This privacy policy serves as a straightforward explanation of how this website
collects and handles your personal information.

This privacy policy was last updated on August 7th, 2013.

### Local Storage

The apps on this website use the HTML5 local storage API to store user-inputted
data and preferences. All of this data remains on your computer, and can be
cleared through your web browser. To be clear, this data is not sent to anyone,
and the data contains no personally-identifiable information whatsoever.

### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics. I only use this information to examine
traffic trends and visitor statistics. However, you would need to read Google's
privacy policy to understand how they collect and use this information.

### Changes

This privacy policy may change at any time. When changes are made, the date at
the top of this policy will be updated. You can view the history of changes to
this policy [on GitHub][policy-history].

If you choose to email me through this website, I will not share your email with
anyone else, nor will I use it for marketing purposes.
